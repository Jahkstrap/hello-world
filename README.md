## Introduction

My name is Geoff and I am at the beginning of my career in technology. I am enrolled in a *Per Scholas* End User Desktop Support course and hope to use a job in IT support as a solid technical foundation to launch a career in a sector more closely related to coding. I have very basic knowledge of C++ and intermediate knowledge of web development using HTML/CSS/JS but am unfamiliar with the various JavaScript frameworks. I am also hoping to make strides in Python over the next few months. My dream is to be able to work in technology and find the financial stability to pursue my other passions including music and travel. 

Over the next few months I want to have **10+ projects** in this repository varying from websites to different algorithm projects both simple and more complex in order to publicly display the skills I have been learning over the last year. A major part of my career plan is creating a robust portfolio in order to show potential employers and peers that *I have the abilities necessary to succeed in this industry.*
